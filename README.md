# CYSE465 Contribution
#For my individual contribution to our final project, I wrote down all the steps taken in order to setup the SVL, the RViz setup and running the simulator (LGSVL) alongside the Vizualizer(Rviz). By writing down these notes we are able to backtrack exactly what we did in the VM so that if mistakes happened, which a whole lot of them did, we were able to easily get right back to where we were and either fix them or find a different way to do them with the same outcome. For the SVL setup, we ran into an issue of the simulation not running even though we did everything correctly. By looking back at the notes written down, we were able to backtrack to before the error, switch up some steps that the ORC fixed for us and then everything worked correctly which allowed for our group to progress very far into the project. Another error we ran into that the notes helped with was when the machineâ€™s network configuration was not working. Looking back at the steps, David was able to realize that he needed to export ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_HOSTNAME which finally allowed for the network to be configured correctly. While David and Viren did most of the work with the VM hands on, I was able to help them a bit by keeping track of what they did with the notes and if they needed to figure out what they did previously, I was able to tell them easily by either showing them the notes themselves or by having them look at the document from their own computers.
